<h1> Welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio!</h1>
<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen;""font-family: sans-serif;">Unfolding writing to build a transparent interface, grasp the comprehensive perception of a user,<br>
and assist sophisticated product consumption, focusing on the relentless shuffle of words to simplify and augment the user understanding. The organized words<br>
are formularized to sense, beaten to crisp sentences, disciplined to imply straightforward notions to appease a squandering user during the product operation.<br> 
Technical writing helps usher the user through intuitive communication predicting the pain points of dwelling in technology. It involes a series of steps to-<br>
reach the immaculate documentation fed to the end user on the plate. It begins from interaction, research, interpretation, peer and ends with multiple rounds of<br> 
technical review.<br>
Befriending the brain behind the development rescues when you fall into trivial doubts while comprehending a feature. The rapport with the<br>
engineers/developers helps smooth knowledge transfer and a viable environment for clarifications. Standing on the same page as the developers is necessary to<br>
avoid repetitive rounds of review, as time is precious for everyone! From being a silent listener to an ebullient questioner, the dual-hatted novice-techie is my<br> 
super point to ponder either aspect before hitting the keyboard.<br>
A thorough understanding of the feature/product paves the way to adequate results. It demands a lot of reading, research, and appropriate interconnection from<br>
the developer inputs. It also builds a strong foundation of the subject area and proves advantageous for further documentation.<br>
Interpreting the inputs and drafts scribbled off the interviews acts as a Kanban board to draw lines to get the whole concept right. It is not a linear graph<br>
but a roller coaster ride to the quintessential document!<br>
