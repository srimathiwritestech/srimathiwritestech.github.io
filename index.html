<h1> Srimathi writes tech</h1>
<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen;""font-family: sans-serif;">Unfolding writing to build a transparent interface, 
 grasp the comprehensive perception of a user, </p> 
 <p>and assist sophisticated product consumption, </p>
 <p>the relentless shuffle and blend of words simplify and uphill the user understanding.

 <h2> Technical Writing </h2>
<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen;">Technical writing: logics apart, helps usher the user 
 through intuitive communication predicting the pain points of dwelling in technology. 
From being a silent listener to an ebullient questioner, the dual-hatted novice-techie 
is my super point to ponder either aspect before hitting the documents. </p>
<h2> Interaction </h2>
<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen;">Befriending the brain behind the product comes to your rescue when you fall into 
 trivial doubts while understanding a feature. The rapt helps smooth knowledge transfer. Standing on the same page as the developers is necessary 
 to avoid repetitive reviews. </p>
