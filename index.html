<h1> My technical writing portfolio </h1>
<p> style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Unfolding writing to build a transparent interface, grasp the comprehensive perception of a user, and assist sophisticated product consumption, the 
  relentless shuffle and blend of words simplify and uphill the user understanding. The words, organized and formularized to sense, appease a squandering user
  in the product operation.</p>
<p> style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Technical writing: logics apart, helps usher the user through intuitive communication predicting the pain points of dwelling in technology. 
From being a silent listener to an ebullient questioner, the dual-hatted novice-techie is my super point to ponder either aspect before hitting the documents. </p>
