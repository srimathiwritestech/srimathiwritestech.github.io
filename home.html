<h1>Srimathi's Writing Philosophy</h1>

<p>Unfolding writing to build a transparent interface, grasp the comprehensive perception of a user, and assist sophisticated product consumption, focusing on the relentless shuffle of words to simplify and augment the user understanding. The organized words are formularized to sense, beaten to crisp sentences, disciplined to imply straightforward notions to appease a squandering user during the product operation.</p>

<p>Technical writing helps usher the user through intuitive communication predicting the pain points of dwelling in technology. It involves a series of steps to reach the immaculate documentation fed to the end user on the plate. It begins from interaction, research, interpretation, peer and ends with multiple rounds of technical review.</p>

<p>Befriending the brain behind the development rescues when you fall into trivial doubts while comprehending a feature. The rapport with the engineers/developers helps smooth knowledge transfer and a viable environment for clarifications. Standing on the same page as the developers is necessary to avoid repetitive rounds of review, as time is precious for everyone! From being a silent listener to an ebullient questioner, the dual-hatted novice-techie is my super point to ponder either aspect before hitting the keyboard.</p>

<p>A thorough understanding of the feature/product paves the way to adequate results. It demands a lot of reading, research, and appropriate interconnection from the developer inputs. It also builds a strong foundation of the subject area and proves advantageous for further documentation.</p>

<p>Interpreting the inputs and drafts scribbled off the interviews acts as a Kanban board to draw lines to get the whole concept right. It is not a linear graph but a roller coaster ride to the quintessential document!</p>
