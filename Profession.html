    <h2>A seamless documentation can be achieved only through team work!</h2>
    <p>Technical writing helps usher the user through intuitive communication predicting the pain points of dwelling in technology.</p>
    <p>Befriending the brain behind the development rescues when you fall into trivial doubts while comprehending a feature. The rapport with the engineers/developers helps smooth knowledge transfer and a viable environment for clarifications. Standing on the same page as the developers is necessary to avoid repetitive rounds of review, as time is precious for everyone! From being a silent listener to an ebullient questioner, the dual-hatted novice-techie is my super point to ponder either aspect before hitting the keyboard.</p>
    <p>A thorough understanding of the feature/product paves the way to adequate results. It demands a lot of reading, research, and appropriate interconnection from the developer inputs. It also builds a strong foundation of the subject area and proves advantageous for further documentation.</p>
    <p>Interpreting the inputs and drafts scribbled off the interviews acts as a Kanban board to draw lines to get the whole concept right. It is not a linear graph but a roller coaster ride to the quintessential document!</p>
